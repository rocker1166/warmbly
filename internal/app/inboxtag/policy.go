// Package inboxtag classifies inbound mail into workspace labels and a
// relevance score, using the TypeSafe "Jev" model for the judgments and code
// for everything else.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE POLICY. Every question asked of the model, every threshold,
// and every weight lives here, so the whole policy can be reviewed without
// reading a line of application logic. Nothing below this file decides what a
// label means or when one is applied.
//
// Three rules shape the design, and each one exists because breaking it
// produced a wrong answer in testing:
//
//  1. One call per email. Questions run in parallel against one state ingest,
//     which avoids repeated requests and duplicated state tokens.
//
//  2. The model tags, code decides. No answer here reaches a side effect on its
//     own. decide() in decide.go is the only thing that turns answers into
//     labels, and in this phase labels are all it may produce.
//
//  3. Never ask the model what the system already knows. Direction, sender,
//     campaign context and deterministic automated-message signals are facts.
//     Given only a body, Jev called our own outbound a human reply at 0.94
//     confidence: confidently wrong, and confidence cannot save you from a
//     question that should never have been asked.
