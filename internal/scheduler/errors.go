	// conversation comes from the address the contact first heard from, so the
	// lead waits for it rather than being written to by a stranger.
	//

	// deferral behaves exactly as before; only the contact drawer, which words

// next-due moment, which is the honest answer to "when could this send" but the
// wrong answer to "when should this chain look again": a campaign is one
// self-perpetuating task, so parking it at a next-due three days out also means
// nothing re-reads the campaign for three days. Leads imported in the meantime
// sit at "Queued / Not started" until then.
//
// So a deferral is capped at config.CampaignMaxDeferMinutes. Anything sooner is
// kept as-is, because a near-term defer is already a precise wakeup. Sends are
// unaffected: a tick that fires early and still has nothing due simply defers
// again, and a tick that DID send parks its successor at the paced interval,
// which never goes through here.
